DiceTracker is a simple IOS app to record dice rolls for board/dice games.

## Requirements

IOS 16.2 or later

## Installation

You can download the project directly

## Usage

Use on an IOS device to create games, objects which record data input from the user. Games can also accept input from rollable dice inside of the application.
The app allows for naming games, undoing inputs, rolling one or two dice, and viewing data inside a Swift Chart. You may also create and delete games.
Every game also includes an info screen which shows the amount of rolls, and every roll in order in a scrollable format.

I am open to input on how to optimize this project, as I can always improve.
